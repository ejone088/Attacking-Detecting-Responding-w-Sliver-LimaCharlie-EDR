# VM-Creation-EDR-Installation
Here I will be documenting the creation of 2 virtual machines (Ubuntu &amp; Windows) and installation of LimaCharlie for EDR purposes. The Ubuntu machine will later be used for attacking the Windows machine. I will want to keep track of the action from a learner's and SOC analyst's perspective, therefore, LimaCharlie will be installed on the Windows machine.

First thing's first, the creation of the Windows VM.
